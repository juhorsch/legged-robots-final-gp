    "# Legged Robots - Final Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the development and evaluation of a motion planning and control system for legged robots, specifically addressing the challenges of generating stable and dynamic locomotion. The project leverages a combination of Model Predictive Control (MPC) and trajectory planning to achieve coordinated movements between the robot's base body and its individual legs. The framework has been implemented within the MuJoCo simulation environment, enabling robust evaluation and rapid prototyping of different locomotion strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The codebase is organized into three primary components: **motion planning**, **control**, and **state estimation**. Each component is critical for achieving stable locomotion and is detailed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motion Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "The planner is divided into two levels: a global planner responsible for the base-body motion, and a local planner that calculates foot trajectories and ground contact forces. The global planner computes continuous body motion based on desired linear and angular velocities, while the local planner, using MPC, predicts foot trajectories and contact forces for the immediate future. These planned motions serve as inputs for the control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control System\n",
    "\n",
    "The control architecture consists of two controllers: one for legs in the stance phase and another for legs in the swing phase. The stance controller uses force estimates from the MPC, while the swing controller ensures that the leg follows its predefined trajectory. The outputs from both controllers are combined and applied as control inputs to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State \n",
    "\n",
    "Although state estimation is essential in real-world applications, the focus of this project is on the planning and control components. Therefore, the required state variables, such as joint positions and velocities, are extracted directly from the MuJoCo simulation. Advanced operations like calculating contact Jacobians are performed using MuJoCo's inbuilt capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these core components, the project incorporates several auxiliary modules, including inverse kinematics and dynamic linearization, to support various aspects of the robotâ€™s motion."

    "- **Whole Body Impulse Dynamics (WBID) Implementation:** Future work could include the implementation of Whole Body Impulse Dynamics to compare performance and robustness against the current control strategies. This would enable better handling of high-impact events, such as foot impacts during locomotion.\n"
